# 4. Initialize theme project

1. create an _app.jsx in the "pages" folder after installing the kit module in your dependencies
2. After that, you only need to extract the _app Component with the initializeApp function to complete the theme's
   initial configuration.

```jsx
import themeConfig from './themeConfig';
import YourProvider from './components/YourProvider';

const MyApp = ({ pageProps, Component }) => {
    return (
        <YourProvider>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </YourProvider>
    )
};

export default initializeApp(MyApp, themeConfig);
```

3. Now that the theme has been configured, create a new page named index.jsx

```jsx
const Home = () => {
    const { categories } = useCategories();

    return (
        <div className="pages home--page">
            {
                categories.map((category) => {
                    return (
                        <div className="category" key={category.id}>
                            <p>{category.title}</p>
                        </div>
                    )
                })
            }
        </div>
    )
}

export default withApollo(Home)([ssrQueries.getCategories]);
```

1. Now you have an SSR page. Use the withApollo function to export the component.

_**Note:** There are a number of hooks that use SSRQuery. It is not necessary to use SSRQueries since the hooks can
function independently. The data is fetched from the server in this case. Moreover, the hook only uses the cache, and
the data normalization operation is performed on the server_

It is also important to find the SSRQueries function. Using the function name, you can locate the SSRQuery for each
hook. Although its name is often similar to Hook itself, if the function itself has SSRQuery, its name is written in
JsDoc.
