Q# 5. SSR Pages

SSR pages are similar to CSR pages, as described in previous documents. Only difference is that it is exported with the
help of [withApollo](main-fuctions/with-apollo.md) function. The only thing function does is run queries on the server.

---

## Rules of SSR pages:

1. The authentication of ssr pages is not possible. This means that you can't have a page for SSR that is private or
   guestOnly.

### Example:

```jsx
const SSRPage = () => {

    const somthing = useSmonthing()

    return (
        <h1>{somthing.message}</h1>
    )
}

SSRPage.setPageConfig = {
    private: true //Error
}

export default withApollo(SSRPage)([SSRQueries.getSmonthing]);
```

2. An empty query should not be accepted

```jsx
//Error
export default withApollo(SSRPage)
export default withApollo(SSRPage)()
export default withApollo(SSRPage)([])
```

If you export a page by withApollo you should use SSRQueries

---

Running the query with withApollo has no priority. The order in which queries are written does not matter and all
queries are executed at the same time

### Example:

```jsx
//There is no difference between the execution of these two functions

export default withApollo(SSRPage)([
    SSRQueries.getProducts,
    SSRQueries.getCategories,
    SSRQueries.getStoreInfo,
])

export default withApollo(SSRPage)([
    SSRQueries.getStoreInfo,
    SSRQueries.getCategories,
    SSRQueries.getProducts,
])
```

However, if you want the queries to run in order, you must separate them into arrays. Certain queries may require the
data from their previous queries, with which they can be executed sequentially to have the results in the next array.

### Example:

```jsx
export default withApollo(SSRPage)(
    [SSRQueries.getStoreInfo],
    [SSRQueries.getCategories, SSRQueries.getProducts]
)
```

This previous data, which contains store information, now exist in index one.
