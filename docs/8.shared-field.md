# Shared fields

All hooks in the kit have duplicate names for some fields. In the kit we tried to choose names that made sense for
similar fields. We also used the same functions throughout.

Perhaps the name **loading** and **error** catches your eye more than anything else.

We'll discuss similar fields in hooks in this section.

***

### loading:

This field indicates the hook's loading. It is usually found inside hooks that use query and mutation.

***

### error:

Indicates an error in the actions. It is an object to type it. It shows the error key and error value.

```ts
interface ApolloError {
    [key: string]: string
}
```

***

### pagination:

It is function to handle pagination.

```js
const { count, handleChangePage, page, hasNextPage, pageCount } = usePagination();
```

#### count:

The total count of items in the data.

#### page:

Show the current page number.

#### hasNextPage:

Indicates whether the data has a next page or not.

#### pageCount:

Total number of pages divided by the length of each page.

### handleChangePage:

You can change page with this function.

```jsx
return <button onClick={() => handleChangePage(currentPage + 1)}>next page</button>
```
