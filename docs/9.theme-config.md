# apolloConfig

Here, we will talk in more detail about the Apollo configuration.

apolloConfig is a file in which apollo settings are stored. Among its most important functions is to store the app's
state and GraphQl server address.

### Config example:

You can see the format of configuration writing by importing the ApolloConfig type.

```js
/**
 * @type import('digify-framework').ApolloConfig
 */
const apolloConfig = {
        uri: 'http://localhost:5000/graphql',
        inMemoryCacheConfig: {
            typePolicies: {
                Query: {
                    fields: {
                        //Local state config
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

export default apolloConfig
```

You can see the cache configuration in this document.

You can still use this configuration, but in a more limited way. In this section, you can customize **typePolicies**.
