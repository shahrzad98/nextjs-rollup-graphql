# 1.Module Structure

Let's start with kit structure

The structure of the kit is very simple. You have some hooks, constant like query and mutations and helpers function.

| Name                    | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                | #                                                  |

**Main Function:** In all parts of the theme, the main functions are mandatory

**Hooks:** As their names suggest, hooks perform certain actions. Hooks often normalize data taken from servers and add
functionality to them. They all follow the [React hook rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

1. Additionally, almost all hooks can be run on both the client-side and server-server.
2. There are several nested hooks in the kit itself. If each hook is called in a different parent, it becomes only one
   time mounted. Specifically, the mounting operation is performed. But data normalization, however, is only performed
   once.
